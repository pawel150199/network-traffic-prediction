# Network Traffic Prediction

## Dataset
The data was captured in Europe - dataset Euro28 and in USA - dataset US26 in optical network infrastracture and in the next step was generated using original one.

## Experiments

### Checks if preprocssing can improve
This experiment checks if preprocessing can give us better results using simple models.

### Compare many models both deep and simple models
This experiment checks which models is the best for that purpose.


## How to run experiment?
* To run first experiment run `python3 experiment_1.py`
* To run second experiment run `python3 experiment_2.py`
